## Fragile States

- The World Bank classifies countries into Fragile States to assess the quality of policies, institutions, and their ability to support sustainable growth and poverty reduction
- A Country Policy an Institutional Assesment (CPIA) is done for every country, and is based on 16 different criteria on a 1-6 scale
- Those below a threshold of 3.2 are considered "Fragile, Conflicted and Violent States"
- There are currently 34 countries on the list and are included in my model

## Fragile Countries

## Introduction to Cholera

- Vibrio Cholerae
- A bacterial infection usually found in contaminated/dirty water and food sources
- Found mostly in developing countries with poor water/sanitation
- Contracted by drinking water or eating food that comes in contact with human feces contaminated with the bacteria
- Can cause mild to severe dehydration/diarrhea/vomiting and can lead to death if medical attention and rehydration is not quickly sought  

## Estimated Global Rates

- It is nearly impossible to get an accurate estimate of world wide rates
- Underreporting of the disease is common due to various factors:
    * Poor surveillance of disease 
    * Deaths occurring before diagnoses/reporting
    * Poor and rural areas affected with low access to health services 
    * Mild cases being overlooked as diarrhea 
- The World Health Organization estimates that only 5-10% of contracted cases are reported each year
- The World Health Organization's database of reported numbers varies greatly by year, and many countries/years have missing data

## Example with Afghanistan's Variability in Estimates
```{r out.width='60%'}

knitr::include_graphics('Afghanistan.png')
```

## Data Collection- Population at Risk
- Population at risk was determined by calculating the percentage of the total population without access to improved sanitation.  
- Improved sanitation data was taken from UNICEF and defined as: “percentage of the population using any of the following sanitation facilities, not shared with other households: flush or pour-flush latrine connected to a piped sewer- age system, septic tank or pit latrine; ventilated improved pit latrine; pit latrine with a slab; covered pit; composting toilet.“

## Population at Risk
```{r out.width='90%'}
ggplot(data = JoinedDataMap2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = `PercentW.O.Sanitation`)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option = 'plasma', name = "Percent Without\nSanitation")+ 
  labs(title ="Population at Risk", caption = "Source:UNICEF (2013) State of the World's Children 2013") + 
theme_bw()
```

## Data Collection- Estimated Rates 

- The estimated rate of cholera cases per year was determined by: multiplying the population at risk by the incidence rate in each country. The incidence rate was based on which mortality strata they were classified in

```{r out.width='100%'}

knitr::include_graphics('estimates.png')
```


## Data Collection- Estimated Number of Deaths

- Determined by multiplying the estimated number of cases in each country, by the cholera case fatality rate (CFR)
- CFR was taken from the same database as the incidence rates, and applied to each country strata as before
- Administered the same rate to all age groups because death rates are very high among all age groups


## Percent Without Adequate Water
```{r out.width='90%'}
ggplot(data = JoinedDataMap2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = `PercentW.O.H2O`)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option = 'plasma', name = "Percent Without\nSanitation")+ 
  labs(title ="Percent Without Improved Water", caption = "Source: UNICEF (2013) State of the World's Children 2013 
") + 
  theme_bw()
```

## Percent Practicing Open Defecation
```{r out.width='90%'}
ggplot(data = JoinedDataMap2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, na.rm=TRUE)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = `opendeficationpercent`)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option = 'plasma', name= "Open Defication\nPercent")+ 
  labs(title =  "Percent Practicing Open Defecation", caption = "Source:World Health Organization Data Base") + 
  theme_bw()
```

## Health Expenditure Per Capita in U.S. Dollars

```{r out.width='90%'}
ggplot(data = JoinedDataMap2, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = `HealthExpendPerCapita`)) + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option = 'plasma', name = "Health Expend\nPer Capita")+ 
  labs(title = "Health Expenditure per capita in dollars", caption = "Source:World Bank Data Base") + 
  theme_bw()
```

## Equations

Cross-sectional country level data from 2010 only

$CholeraRate_i=\beta Fragile+X_i\Gamma+e$

$CholeraRate_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Fragile + \beta_2 W.O.H2O + \beta_3 HealthExped + \beta_4 PrecentDef + e$

$PopulationAtRisk_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Fragile + \beta_2 W.O.H2O + \beta_3 HealthExped + \beta_4 PrecentDef + e$

$EstmatedDeath_i=\beta_0+\beta_1 Fragile + \beta_2 W.O.H2O + \beta_3 HealthExped + \beta_4 PrecentDef + e$
